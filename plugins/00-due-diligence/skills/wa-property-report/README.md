# wa-property-report

Comprehensive due-diligence report for a site in Western Australia. One guided workflow, one structured report, all the checks an architect needs before design work starts.

## What it covers

- **Cadastre & Title** — lot / plan, site area, proprietor, encumbrances (easements, covenants, caveats, Memorials)
- **Heritage** — State Register (inHerit), Local Heritage Survey, Heritage Areas, adjoining listings
- **DA history** — LGA DA register, building permits, SAT appeals and precedents
- **Contamination** — DWER Contaminated Sites Database classifications
- **Bushfire** — DFES Bush Fire Prone Areas designation + BAL implications
- **Coastal** — SPP 2.6 setback horizons, CHRMAP declarations
- **Flood** — LGA flood mapping, floodway designation
- **Aboriginal heritage** — AHIS registered and other recorded places
- **Flora, fauna, TECs** — NatureMap, DBCA, significant trees
- **Acid sulfate soils** — DWER risk mapping
- **Services** — overhead / in-ground infrastructure notes

## When to run it

- Before entering a conditional contract for a site purchase
- At project inception, even for sites already owned by the client
- Before a pre-DA design feasibility
- Before formal DA lodgement, as a final sweep for missed issues

## Output

A single markdown report (`property-report-[address-slug].md`) structured into:

1. Summary table + overall risk rating
2. Findings across all 11 check areas
3. Traffic-light risk summary
4. Recommended specialist consultants
5. Sources and dates

## Scope — be honest

This skill is a **guided workflow**. It does not:

- Buy Certificate of Title searches (user does this via Landgate, ~$29.20)
- Replace a conveyancing lawyer's title review
- Replace a Phase 1 / Phase 2 Environmental Site Assessment
- Replace an s. 18 consent assessment under the *Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972* (WA)

What it does:

- Makes sure no data source is missed
- Applies WA-specific interpretation to the findings
- Produces a report that stands on its own for client, file, or consultant handover
- Flags material issues with consistent traffic-light status
